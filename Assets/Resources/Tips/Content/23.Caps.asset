  _title: What happens if Patapons die?
  _content: 'When a Patapon die, they drop their lifecap, if they''re not eaten.
    If a Patapon gets the cap, the Patapon gains health. If the cap is from the General,
    all of the same class gain health. The collected dead cap is burried under the
    Mater tree, Patapons are reborn, and able to keep fighting.

    Don''t worry,
    even if any Patapon is eaten, while Patapons taking rest on their Patapolis,
    Gong and Zigoton army will bring back the lifecap, so there will be no unit lost!'

  _content: 'Patapookas and some Patapon non-players are now Generals in gameplay!

    Generals
    cannot equip anything but helm (or other protector, depending on the class),
    but  they has special ability to help their classes when they are alive. All
    of Generals can communicate with Almighty, receive holy drum commands, and send
    order to the other Patapons - Hatapon is not necessary in battlefields anymore.

    If
    all generals die, the game is over and the mission fails. Don''t worry! There''s
    no other penalty than losing the mission progression, you can try again when
    you''re ready!'

  _content: 'Many range units are weak, and they are pushed back when enemies come
    close.

    Using Tatepons with "Defend Only" can prevent that, but it consumes
    one space for Patapon classes. Besides, Tatepons die too.

    Summoned boss
    also can work as shield. Level-up enough the boss field to level-up the boss,
    and it''ll unlock the true defending power!'

  _title: Elemental attack and Gem
  _content: 'Weapons don''t decide elemental attack type, but Gems do. There are
    fire, ice, and thunder gem that grants elemental power. Depends on enemies, specific
    elemental attack deals more damage than other elemental attack.

    Gem is unobtainable
    through missions, so you need to play minigame from May to get one. Don''t worry,
    you can practice without losing item!'

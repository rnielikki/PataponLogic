  _title: How difficulty affects in game?
  _content: 'Easy mode can make easily perfect hit, which means gameplay easier like
    maximum damaging or activating general mode. But the easy difficulty has some
    limits.

    For example, the harder the difficulty mode is, the boss reward
    amount and equipment drop chances rises. It even affects to some General modes!
    The difficulty also affects to the maximum levels of the fields. So if you can
    play well, avoid using easy mode and you''ll get better rewards.

    Some bosses
    unlock another bosses in specific level, but easy mode can''t open the new level.'

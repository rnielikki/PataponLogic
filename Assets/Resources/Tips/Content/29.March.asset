    Not all levels are like that, for example, boss maps doesn''t have perfect marching
    condition. Especially some missions, which require to chase something, have perfect
    marching condition.

    Pressing Patapata song on right rhythm is the only way
    to go with this condition. You can go forward with bad rhythm, but Patapons will
    move forward slowly!'

    2, once a Rarepon is unlocked, every Patapon can use it.

    Rarepons cannot
    equip helm, but it''s way more valuable than helm. Rarepons can affect attack
    type resistance, which can''t be changed by equipping anything. Each Rarepon
    has different strength and weakness, so read descriptions before unlocking!'

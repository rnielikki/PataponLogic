  _content: 'Critical/Critical Resistance is not status effect, but it rather works
    as specific damage multiplier. If attacker''s critical rate is much bigger than
    receiver, it gives massive damage. Also being immune to critical damage can gradually
    reduce some attacks.

    When critical damage is dealt, the damage number is
    displayed as gradient, which makes the number also darker.

    Note that structure
    or structure-type enemies are immune to critical attack!'

  _content: 'There is no available material for Minigame or Rarepons, in your progress?
    No problem! Visit material exchange Zigoton NPC to ask trading.

    Every time
    the material is exchanged, the rate rises, and will require more material next
    time. The higher the material level is, the exchange rate rises faster. There
    is no way to drop exchange rate, so use the service wisely. We warned you!'

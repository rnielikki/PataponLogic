  _title: Special boss moves
  _content: 'Each boss basically has a special move that deals much damage - more
    precisely, most of them has high critical ratio. When a boss is preparing the
    special move, the boss is immune to all status effects. Watch out, and don''t
    even dare to bother them with any status effect!

    Some easy bosses don''t
    have that special move until they reach level 10.'

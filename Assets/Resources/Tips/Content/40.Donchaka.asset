  _title: Make use of Donchaka song
  _content: 'If grass fires or freezing snow disturbs Patapons, just call PATA PON
    DON CHAKA! The song doesn''t only cure Patapons, but also make Patapons ignore
    any status effect in the turn. Also the command brings Patapons to their original
    place.

    Be careful, it still doesn''t do anything with elemental weakness.
    For example, if a Patapon is weak to fire rate, it doesn''t catch fire with donchaka
    song, but if fire attack deals damage in that turn, it still hurts a lot.

    A
    General mode of Donchaka song even heal the Patapons! If you can find one...'

  _content: 'Some Patpaon classes have naturally a bit better sight than others.
    When the enemies are in sight and use Ponpon song, Patapons attack, but if enemies
    are not in their sight, they don''t attack (or try to attack and then stop).

    Enemies,
    like animals, have sight too. Mochichi (bird) have good sight, while Kacheek
    (boar) has bad sight. Animals try to flee (or attack and flee) when the target
    is on their sight.

    Foggy weather decrease every sight.'

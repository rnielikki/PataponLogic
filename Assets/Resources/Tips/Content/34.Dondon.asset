  _title: Evading attack
  _content: 'Both Ponpata nad Dondon are for evading attack. Somve moves are targeting
    on the ground, with wide range. In this case, Ponpata is not an option to evade
    correctly. Toripons in fever mode don''t need to use Dondon attack to evade these
    kind of attacks.

    Meanwhile, some attacks drop from high position. In this
    case, Dondon song do nothing.

    Unlike Ponpata, Dondon has identical jumping
    time, regardless of perfection rate. Instead, Ponpata can evade many attacks,
    including fire breathing.'

    - Which one can hold important
    General mode for long time, also for which one the General mode is useful?

    -
    Which status effect is needed for this level, and which Rarepon/Boss can achieve

    - What''s the strength and weakness of classes, and is can they maximise
    their strength or minimise their weakness in this level?

    And the victory
    is yours! You don''t always need to grind best equipment with right strategy!'

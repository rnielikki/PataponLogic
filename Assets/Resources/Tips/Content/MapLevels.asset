  _content: 'Replayable missions, except hunting field, has level. When the map level
    rises, enemies'' stat rises. Bosses get more status effect immunity, and Ponpata
    song becomes more difficult. Depending on the mission, additional difficulty

    Leveling up boss map is worth it, because not only summoned
    boss level also rises, but also the boss drops better items.'

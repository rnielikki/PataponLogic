  _title: One blow or rapid attack?
  _content: 'One blow, like Dekapon, shows so much damage and looks awesome. But
    rapid attack is great for inflicting status effect, since each attack has chance
    to status effect.

    Kibapon is very good example of rapid attack. Megapon''s
    no fever mode attack is weak, but it can hit multiple time, which can cause chance
    to inflict status effect.'

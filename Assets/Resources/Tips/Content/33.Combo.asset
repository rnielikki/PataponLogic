  _title: Boss combo attack
  _content: 'Some bosses use combo from first level, but most mandatory bosses don''t
    use combo attack from very first. Still if they reach level 9, they start to
    use combo attack. If level is high enough, it can use more than two combos!

    The
    combo attack is annoying, but if you watch carefully, you have chance to avoid.
    The decision term is way shorter than without combo, so hold tight and keep watching
    the move! It can be difficult for first time, but once if get used to it, it''s
    way easier. Unlike berserk mode, the attack is still predictable and evadable

    Status
    effect (other than fire) can end the combo attacks. Also, bosses can''t use combo
    attack on ice.'

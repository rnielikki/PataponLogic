  _title: Summoning boss
  _content: 'Once you reached fever, use DON-DONDON-DONDON to summon boss! Below
    the fever worm, you can see how many boss you can summon. When boss dies, you
    can summon again, as far as  you have your summon ball below the fever worm.

    All
    bosses are immune to tumble attack. Some bosses can change weather. Summon the
    boss before the boss die to keep the effect. Depending on the boss, it can be
    immune to other status effects like knockback.

    Summoned boss level is directly
    connected to the boss field. Level-up the boss field to make your summoned boss
    stronger.

    Boss doesn''t evade attack, but they''re strong enough to help
    your team.'

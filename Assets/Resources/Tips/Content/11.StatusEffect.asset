  _title: Status Effect
  _content: 'There are 6 status effects: "Stagger/Knockback/Tumble/Fire/Ice/Sleep".

    Stagger
    works for every character. Knockback throws small characters back. When a boss
    gets knockback, it cannot do anything. Some bosses are immune to knockback. Some
    knockbacking moves that targeting small characters ignore knockback resistance/immunity.
    Tumble is earthquake effect, which makes small characters cannot attack in very
    short time. Bosses are not affected to tumble attacks.

    When on status effect,
    some characters cannot attack at all, like Patapons or Hazorons. Boss with fire
    or ice status still can attack, but attack on ice status is very limited.

    Structures
    ignore every effect except fire. Some bosses are naturally immune to specific
    status effects. Patapons and Hazorons are basically not immune to anything, but
    can boost the resistance or make immune with equipments or Rarepons. Status effect
    can stop the outragious boss combo attacks! But remember, when a boss level rises,
    they are also stronger against status effects.

    While one has status effect,
    that one can''t get any other status effect!'

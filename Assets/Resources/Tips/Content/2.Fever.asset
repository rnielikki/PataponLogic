  _title: Combo and Fever mode
  _content: 'When command is hit in right turn, a worm called "combo/fever worm"
    appears left of the screen. If the perfect hit is enough, the fever mode starts.
    Fever mode also starts without perfect hit, when the combo reaches 8 (easy) or
    10 (normal, hard).

    Keeping the fever mode is important part of the game.
    In fever mode, Patapons deal more damage. Also some attacks are different in
    fever mode. For example, Yaripons jump on the fever mode. Try to keep fever!

    Also,
    the fever worm shows how perfect the drum hits were, after the command. If the
    gauge stays on minimum, the effect of command is minimum.'

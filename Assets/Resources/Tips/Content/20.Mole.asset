  _title: Mole of Miracle
  _content: 'After the disaster, Miracle totem hid its body into ground. It appears
    only in the blessed field, but it''s hard to catch.

    When it''s damaged enough,
    it shows up the body and drops rain. Not much damage is required for calling
    the miracle, the only difficulty with the mole is the timing. Tumbling can take
    it to the ground a little while, make attacking a bit easier.

    The mole changes
    default weather, but after summoning weather-changing boss, the weather will
    be changed to rain. In battlefields with miracle, be careful of the order!'

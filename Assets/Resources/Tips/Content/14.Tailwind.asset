  _content: 'Some attacks like arrow, sound or spore are affected to the wind direction.
    If enemies are attacking in the tower, tailwind will help to save range units
    on distance. The arrow or sound unit changes their position to make their attack
    hit, which means Yumipons attack from longer range in tailwind.

    By default,
    wind direction is nothing or changing. The direction can be changed by summoning
    specific bosses.'

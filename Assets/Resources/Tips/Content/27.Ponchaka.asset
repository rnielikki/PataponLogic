  _title: The song of Ponchaka
  _content: 'Ponchaka song is charging song. Ponchaka song alone doesn''t do anything,
    but ponchaka~ponpon and ponchaka~chakachaka is more effective than the same two
    commands(ponpon/chakachaka) in a row.

    Some classes have special move in
    Ponchaka~ponpon or Ponchaka~chakachaka. Some bosses use different move for charged
    attack or charged defence.

    Ponchaka is useful, but there''s risk to waste
    your one turn, if you decides to use other than ponpon or chakachaka as next
    command.'

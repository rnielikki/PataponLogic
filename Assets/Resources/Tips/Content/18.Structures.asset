  _content: 'Structures or structure-type bosses are immune to critical, and not
    affecteed by status effect, except fire. Looks like tough, but usually those
    are weak against crush damage.

    Like structures, grasses don''t receive any
    status effect but burning effect. Grass has ability to spread fire. Once a grass
    is burnt out, it has no ability to spread fire anymore. Strong fire-type attack
    can burn the grass, but any damage to grass isn''t displayed.'
